# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave us a list of tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. Using our analytical skills and knowledge of Python, we could create a fast, and simple way to determine the winner of the election. To do this, we have to:   

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources:
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.3, Visual Studio Code 1.46.0

## Summary
### The analysis of the election show that:

* There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

* The candidates were:

    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane

* The candidate results were:

    - **Charles Casper Stockham** received ***23.0%*** of the vote and ***85,213*** number of votes.

    - **Diana DeGette** received ***73.8%*** of the vote and ***272,892*** number of votes.

    - **Raymon Anthony Doane** received ***3.1%*** of the vote and ***11,606*** number of votes.

### The winner of the election was:

- **Diana DeGette** who received 272,892 number of votes, 73.8% of the total votes cast in the election.

## Challenge Overview
Colorado Board of Elections employee wanted to further our analysis by narrowing down the votes by county. With the loops we created before, we could use the same format to not only find the number of votes and percentage per county, but also which county held the largest amount of voters. To add to our Project Overview, we had to:

1. Calculate the amount of voters for each county
2. Calculate the percentage of voters for each county
3. Determine which county had the largest turnout


## Challenge Summary:
### Election Results:
    Total Votes: 369,711

### County Results:

    Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

### Largest County Turnout: 
    Denver

### Candidate Results:

    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

    Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

### Election Winner:

    Diana DeGette:

    Vote Count: 272,892

    Percentage: 73.8%
